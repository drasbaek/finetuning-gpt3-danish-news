# Dummy Results
All files in this folder are dummy results that come from running the dummy files in the `src` folder. As these scripts rely on limited data (from `dummy_data`), the results likely have no intelligible information. 

> NOTE! This is different from files in the `dummy_data` folder which is data that has been constructed to mimic the real data as close as possible.
